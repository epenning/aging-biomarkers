## Project Title

Aging Biomarkers

## Project Description

Our project goals are to explore the relationships between biomarkers or
other survey data and age.

In Part I, we plan to explore aspects (e.g., socioeconomic
status, demographics) or biomarkers (e.g. blood pressure, oral health, etc.) in relation to age and age categories (early aging, middle aging, late aging).

In Part II, the tentative plan is to determine significant
biomarkers that can be used in a regression to predict the biological
age of an individual. For example, perhaps a marker such as blood
pressure might indicate that a person might be at risk for suffering
age-related complications sooner in life.

## Dataset Description

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) contains
multiple studies assessing health and nutrition of adults and children
in the United States. It offers a number of different data files
containing interview results and physical examinations, for example lab
test results.

We will be downloading a subset of these data files for our exploratory
analysis based on which variables are interesting to us.

# Additional Info

This review article provided the inspiration for determining biological
age as a function of biomarkers available from test results. Their
methods will differ from ours, but it provides some starting points for
which biomarkers might be of interest to us.
