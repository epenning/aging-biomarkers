# Project Title: Aging Biomarkers

## Motivation

The global aging population is projected to triple between 2017 and 2050, increasing from 137 million to 425 million. Aging overall costs the economy $36 billion dollars a year in terms of pension, aging care, and health services. To contribute to insights about health and aging, as well as produce an age-prediction model based on health markers, our overall project goal involves exploring relationships between biomarkers and related survey data and age to provide insights on health and age and possibly create a prediction model for age based on biomarkers.

## Objectives
- Part I: Explore the relationships between biomarkers (e.g blood pressure) and age.
- Part II: Utilize biomarker data to create a model that predicts the biological age of an individual.
 
## Background

A study by Hastings et al. (2019) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599717/> in "Psychoneuroendrocrinology" theorized that changes in biomarker levels as we age lead to several different age-related diseases.  A biomarker is defined as "a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes" and include measurements like serum albumin levels and alkaline phosphatase levels. The Hastings project reported that cellular-level markers (e.g. telomere length) are more informative than patient-level physiological measures.  Our project focused on biomarker laboratory test results and demographic data.

## Dataset Description

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) contains multiple studies assessing health and nutrition of adults and children in the United States. It offers a number of different survey result data files containing interview results, physical examinations, and laboratory test results. Our study focused on the NHANES 2017-2018 dataset, specifically Demographic Data for adults and aging population and Laboratory test results.
